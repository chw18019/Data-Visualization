### Introduction
Hey all,

   This is Chi-Hua Wu, and I'm currently studying master of business analytics and project management at Uconn. While I am the teaching assistant for OPIM5512-Data Science using Python, I made some new materials for students to help them to be more familiar with the concepts and Python. I think it can be benifits to people on Internet as well.
   
   This repository meant for the general practice of exploratory data analysis(EDA) and data visualization using the classic Boston Housing Dataset. Google Colaboratory is used in this file, and I think it's easier for beginners to start Python. The following shows the packages includes in this file.

*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn
*   Pandas Profiling
*   AutoViz
*   Geographic data with Basemap

You can access more details in the offical website of each packages.

### EDA
EDA gives the roughly distribution for variables you care about. Descriptive statistics is also very helpful to get you more sense and understanding of your data. 

### Visualization 
Besides understanding the data itself, it's also important to communicate with people who don't have much mathmatics background. Therefore, the visualization provides an easy way to understand the data. Several plots can be used in specific situations.

### Geographic data 
For the geographic data, I found a very interesting interactive package called kepler. However, it can be only used in Jupyter notebook or lab as I known. Please check it out.


Thanks for reading, until next time!
